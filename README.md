# DongPong

DongPong is an interactive game that utilizes Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect features and append a "dong" to the player's body, which can then be used as a pong paddle in a classic pong game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/RParkerE/DongPong.git`

2. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy`

## How to Play

1. Run the `dongpong.py` script:

`python dongpong.py`

2. Stand in front of your camera so that your body is visible.

3. A "dong" will be appended to your body, which you can then use as a paddle to play the pong game.

4. Use your body movements to control the paddle and hit the ball.

5. The game ends when you miss hitting the ball with your paddle.
